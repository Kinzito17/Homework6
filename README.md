# Homework6

<p> For this assignment I was tasked with building a weather dashboard that when prompted by user with a search city will return the current weather and the following five day forecast. Each time the user searches a new city, their results will be appended as a list of buttons that can be clikced to view those results again. If the user exits the browser or refreshes the window they will be shown their most recent search result.
